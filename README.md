# covid19
Data processing scripts for publicly-available covid19 data

# Usage
Get the data from `git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git`, then set the paths at the top of `main.py`.

Run and obtain a plot of cumulative cases of COVID-19 by geographical region. The data source reports that it is updated daily, and these scripts should automatically take pulled updates into account.
